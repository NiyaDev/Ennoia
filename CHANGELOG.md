- Started more work on render pipeline, but ran into issues with lists in general.

#### [9/13/25]
- Got the 3D part of the pipeline working without any leaks!!
- Added texture instancing. It doesn't work and i'm going to rehaul the entire thing. But I added it.

#### [9/15/25]
- Fixed texture instancing. Turns out I never put in color, so they were just invisible.
- Changed ennoia::clean to clear instead of free to allow tests to go sequencially.
- Fully changed over from immediate mode UI to new system.
  - Label + Button finished.

#### [9/16/25]
- Started on Containers.

- Finished Texture tiling.
- Next session *HAS* to be me cleaning everything up...

#### [9/21/25]
- Cleaned up mesh.c3
  - Seperated mesh constants into file.
  - Removed Models completely and changed all references to meshes.
- Cleaned up texture.c3
  - Seperated draing functions into new file.
  - Removed draw_tiled.
- Fixed the magic number issue in drawing textures.
  - Turns out it was the percentage the section was of the total texture height.
- Fixed memory leak with UI elements being added over each other.

#### [9/24/25]

- Fixed generateing cube mesh too small.
- Started merging start_drawing and end_drawing.
- Immediate-mode UI:
  - Added Texture.
  - Added Tiled Texture.
- Added priority system 5->0 for pipeline textures. Higher is drawn first.
  - Still need to do something similar for 3D transparency.

#### [9/26/25]
-  Moved basic structures into seperate directory.

#### [9/27/25]
- Added dubiously working imm::container_drag.
- Added ennoia::mouseDelta to see change in mouse position since last frame.
- Fixed library error with ennoia::mousePosition being used as ennoia::mousPosition.
- Fixed library error with keybinds::mouse(down, up, pressed) having a String input instead of uint.

#### [9/30/25]
- Started on Debug utilities. Didn't get far.

#### [10/1/25]
- Fixed print_color.
- Added debug Error, Warning, and Info.
  - Error closes program.

#### [10/2/25]
- Converted Vector2 (float x,y)     to Vec2f (float[<2>]) and Vec2i.
- Converted Vector3 (float x,y,z)   to Vec3f (float[<3>]) and Vec3i.
- Converted Vector4 (float x,y,z,w) to Vec4f (float[<4>]) and Vec4i.
- Removed my version of Quaternion and started using maths Quaternionf.
- Converted Color (char r,g,b,a) to (char[<4>]).
- Started working on using Matrix4f from std::math instead of my own, but maybe i need to use my own?
  - It seems like it may be a different layout from OpenGL. Which is weird...
  - Changed: matrix.c3, uniforms.c3, mesh.c3, pipeline.c3, camera.c3, system/drawing.c3, and system/core.c3.

#### [10/3/25]
- Still trying to figure out matrix nonsense.
  - Got an idea to try tomorrow.

#### [10/4/25]
- FIXED MATRIXES!! It was stupid too!
  - I never transposed the perspective matrix in system/core.c3.
- Removed all references to matrix.

#### [10/5/25]
- Started working on Screenshots, but realized the stb bindings are just not enough.
  - so I started on making my own bindings for spng.
