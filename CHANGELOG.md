== v0.1.0

==== [6/30/25]
- Migrated over Vectors 2-4, Quaternion, and Matrixes from Pleroma.
- Moved VAO, VBO, and EBO into Trio structure that isn't kept in mesh and made it so that the mesh is uploaded when drawing and deleted after.
- Fixed: Flipped loaded texture.
- Fixed: Not saving vertices and indices to mesh structure.

==== [7/1/25]
- Migrated ennoia.c3 to gl.c3 and started on base Ennoia functions.
- Started on camera.

==== [7/2/25]
- Moved shader compilation to seperate function to allow both loading from file and raw data.
- Re-added default shaders.
- Changed how rendering models works. It doesn't fully work yet.

==== [7/3/25]
- Meshes now render properly.
- Camera now works properly.
- Re-added framebuffer size callback and it now updates properly.
- Fixed: Matrixes were using "row-major" instead of "column-major".
  - Need to look to see if I need to fix any matrix functions. look_at and perspective didn't, so possibly not.

==== [7/4/25]
- Added wrappers to end drawing and clearing bg.
- Added scrollwheel handling.
- Changed camera to function off of target and distance to target instead of target-position.
  - Rotation is almost done, something went wrong and it crashes.
- Minor functions added to vector3 and floats.

==== [7/5/25]
- Finished camera rotation.
- Experimenting with mesh generation.

==== [7/6/26]
- Moved everything hap-hazardly from GLFW to SDL3. It draws, but i still need to properly handle input.

==== [7/7/25]
- Added mutliple SDL3 constants.

==== [7/8/25]
- Added keybinding system.
- Re-added mousewheel controls.

==== [7/9/25]
- Changed Vertexes from an array of floats to an actual structure.
- Made a wrapper for vertex_attrib_pointer to simmplify code.
- Removed "Trio" and replaced with a tuple.

==== [7/10/25]
- Minor changes

==== [7/11/25]
- Started on adding rendering to a texture
  - Something is wrong, but i don't know what yet...
- Added int shader uniforms

==== [7/12/25]
- Mesh:
  - Removed Matrix and draw_at
  - Added VAO/VBO, position, scale, and rotation to draw
- Fixed Matrix rotation
- Started changing how shader uniforms are changed and set.
- Render texture quad is being rendered and a *different* texture can be drawn on it, but for some reason the render texture cant...

==== [7/13/25]
- Finally fixed render texture. The problem was I was using glTextureParameteri instead of glTexParameteri. So stupid.
- Added rendering at a lower or higher resolution than screen.
- Added shader cleanup and rendertexture shader changing.
- Changed over from using add_loc and set_loc to just using set_X where X is the data type.

==== [7/14/25]
- Moved drawing functions from wrappers to ennoia, but might still move them to render.
- Created render.c3 and moved rendertexture initialization over.

==== [7/15/25]
- Created mesh generation functions.
- Started working on texture drawing.

==== [7/16/26]
- Renamed basic shaders and added 2d shader.
- Added clean functions for Mesh, Render texture, texture, and ennoia in general.
- Fully added drawing a texture to screen.

==== [7/17/25]
- Minor changes

==== [7/18/25]
- Started work on Bulk v2 and then restarted because I wanted to go in a different direction.

==== [7/19/25]

==== [7/22/25]
- Bulk:
  - Basic Bulk packer finished and able to add and remove entries from bulk files.
  - Functions for getting entry length or pointer.
  - Function for getting textures.
- Function for loading texture from array (memory).

==== [7/23/25]
- Added keybinds loading from bulk
- Added saving Keybinds to file
- Added Options system as well as saving and loading from bulk. Still needs to be tested.

==== [7/24/25]
- Added Rectangles
- Texture Draw
  - Moved Position + Size into a rectangle dest.
  - Added Rectangle src to draw a specific portion of the texture.

==== [7/25/25]
- Font loading, both from file and data
- Font drawing with scaling and spacing

==== [7/26/25]
- Moved wrapper.c3 funtions to ennoia.c3
- Added function to meshes to update texcoords

==== [7/27/25]
- Renamed TODO and CHANGELOG.
- Created bounds.c3 for bounding box checking.
- Made tests for Bulk and fixed memory leaks in loading, read_entries, and get_entry_len/ptr.

==== [7/28/25]
- Moved SDL3 bindings to their own project.

==== [7/29/25]
- Minor
