## v0.1.0

### High prio
- Write tests
  - There IS a leak in the test program. I need to find it.
  - If I wait too long the debt is going to be insane...
- Move ~SDL3~ and OpenGL binds to seperate projects for simplicity
- 2D rendering seems to be in reverse order.

### Mid prio
- Bulk
  - Loading different file types
    - Meshes
      - Able to load materials from the same bulk file
    - Localization
    - etc
- Meshes
  - Functions to edit specific vertex things and have it update the mesh internally
  - Culling

### Low prio
- UI
- If you tap shift while holding a direction it keeps going even after you let go

### Future
- Re-write files from Pleroma:
  - vector.c3 -Started
  - matrix.c3
- Confirm all matrix.c3 functions work
- Copy over compatible tests from Pleroma
- Loading fonts from bulk
- Mesh generation: Plane, etc
