## v0.1.0

### High prio
- Write tests
  - If I wait too long the debt is going to be insane...
- Move ~SDL3~ and OpenGL binds to seperate projects for simplicity
- 2D rendering seems to be in reverse order.

### Mid prio
- UI
  - When drawing text apply color codes and things like "\n"
- Change shaders and mesh to allow color input
- Bulk
  - Loading different file types
    - etc
- Meshes
  - Culling

### Low prio
- If you tap shift while holding a direction it keeps going even after you let go

### Future
- Re-write files from Pleroma:
  - matrix.c3
- Confirm all matrix.c3 functions work
- Copy over compatible tests from Pleroma
- Mesh generation: Plane, etc
